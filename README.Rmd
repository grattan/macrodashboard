This repo contains builds a Shiny dashboard of graphs relevant to Grattan Institute's
work on macroeconomic policy.

This is an *unfinished work in progress*.

The live dashboard can be found at: [https://mattcowgill.shinyapps.io/macrodashboard/](https://mattcowgill.shinyapps.io/macrodashboard/)

# Data

All data for the dashboard comes via the `macro_dashboard_data` repo, [available here](https://github.com/MattCowgill/macro_dashboard_data/). That repo contains
functions to download the latest version of each dataset, do some minimal tidying,
and then write files to its 'data' directory. The functions in `macro_dashboard_data`
execute on a schedule using GitHub Actions, so that the data stays up-to-date.

# Structure

The 'R' folder of this repo contains:

 - files beginning with `viz_`. These take a dataframe as input and return a ggplot2
 plot as output. There is one function per file.
 - `dash_app.R`. This contains the server-side code for the Shiny app.
 - `dash_ui.R`. This contains the UI code for the Shiny app.
 - `globals.R`. This file defines global variables, to prevent warnings regarding
 functions that use non-standard evaluation.
 - `load_data.R` This file contains a function (`load_data()`) that gets data
 from the `macro_data_dashboard` repo.
